# KafkaMicroservicesDemo

This repository contains a Java project developed with Spring Boot that serves as a comprehensive example of how to build and deploy Kafka-based microservices applications. The purpose of this project is to provide a detailed and practical understanding of how Kafka works within a microservices architecture.

## Overview

Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that enables the building of real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It provides high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and horizontally scalable messaging capabilities, making it an ideal choice for building event-driven microservices architectures.

This project showcases various aspects of Kafka, including:

- **Producer and Consumer:** Demonstrates how to create Kafka producers and consumers using Spring Kafka to publish and consume messages.
  
- **Topics and Partitions:** Illustrates the concept of topics and partitions in Kafka and how they facilitate the distribution and parallel processing of messages.

- **Spring Boot Integration:** Integrates Kafka seamlessly with Spring Boot, leveraging its dependency management, autoconfiguration, and other features to streamline development.

- **Microservices Architecture:** Implements a microservices architecture where different services communicate via Kafka topics, showcasing how Kafka enables loose coupling and asynchronous communication between services.

- **Error Handling and Monitoring:** Implements error handling mechanisms and integrates Kafka with monitoring and logging solutions to ensure the reliability and observability of the application.

## Getting Started

To run the Kafka microservices application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure that you have Java JDK **17**, Apache Kafka, and Maven installed on your system.

2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rattle-Brain/KafkaMicroservicesDemo.git
   ```

3. **Build the Project:** Navigate to the project directory and build the project using Maven:

   ```bash
   cd KafkaMicroservicesDemo
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Start Kafka Cluster:** Start a local Kafka cluster with ZooKeeper and Kafka brokers configured.

5. **Run the Application:** Run the Spring Boot application using Maven or your preferred IDE:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

6. **Access the Application:** Access the endpoints exposed by the microservices application and observe the message flow within the Kafka topics.
